Once again trying to learn web dev, this time following the tutorial x from fujo webdev
I actucally understand better how to use git and github in a work process now!

finished ep 0: x and ep 1: x
Set up deployment on vercel, programmmed with codium and set up the SSG astro
didn't follow any of the html & css parts since i know most of it

these are not the technologies i want to use but is will use them for this tutorial so i am not overwhelming myself again
in the future i would like to use geany as my code editor, publish to neocities or somewhere similar, use Go for the server side and htmx on the frontend

did some designing on paper of what sit im doing
i think i need more website ideas bc im just making a project page again for the nth time...
